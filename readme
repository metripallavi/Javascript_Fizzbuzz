# String Reversal Challenge

To test the string reversal function:

1. Open the `script.js` file.
2. Look for the `originalString` variable.
3. Replacing the value of `originalString` with the string "coding challenge" which was asked to reverse.
4. Run the script, and the string is reversed.
